# Backgroud
One of problems I met is the credential doesn't work. The only information I received is that I need to create a new user. Here is the note to explain how to create a new account. 
Appreciate Vivian's help to figure out how to proceed. She is also the person who reminded me that I should try to document this and share.

# How to solve this:
## Step1: You need to go to AWS following the below steps:
### Click "Launch AWS Gateway"

## Step2: Once you're transferred to AWS webpage, fine IAM webpage:
### Click "Services" at the left top 
### Then Click "IAM" under "Security, Identity, & Compliance"
